# Mass-Transfer-and-Reassign-Activities

Do you have a very dynamic org and often need to reassign opportunities from one rep. to another? This app will help you search and reassign multiple opportunities, matching certain criteria or even your own views easily.

This is the easiest way to reassign your opportunities.
You can choose between two methods to search/retrieve your opportunities:
- Using your existing Opportunity views (i.e. my opportunities, my team opportunities etc...)
- Using the provided criteria (Created date range, Sales stage, current owner etc...)

You can mass select opportunities to reassign or manually pick those you want to reassign.

The reassign process also transfers the open activities to the new owner, leaving the closed activities to the former owner.

You can install the published version of this package via the AppExchange listing: https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003JEIp&tab=d
